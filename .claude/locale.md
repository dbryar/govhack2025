### Locale and Language Standards

1. The locale is `en-AU`.
2. The date format is `DD/MM/YYYY`.
3. Use **ISO 8601 format** for dates and times in _technical contexts_.
4. Use **UTC** for time representation in _all_ databases and code references.
   - For user interfaces, use the local time zone of the user and convert at the front end.
5. Use **24-hour time format** (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM) in all technical contexts.
6. Use **SI** (metric) units for all measurements.
7. The preferred written language is **AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH**.
   - use `ou` in words like `colour`, `favour`, `honour`, etc.
   - use `ise` in words like `organise`, `realise`, `recognise`, etc.
   - use double `l` in words like `travelling`, `cancelled`, `labelled`, etc.
   - use the **British** spelling for words like `tyre`, `metre`, `litre`, etc.
   - always use punctuation at the end of sentences, even in code comments.
8. Use **American English** in all code functions where it is expected, especially in HTML and CSS.
   - Use `center` instead of `centre`.
