# Unicode Fixes - COMPLETED

## Summary
All requested fixes have been successfully implemented and the service is running at https://staging-transliterate-5dsi.encr.app/app

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unicode Handling ✅
- **Issue**: Unicode characters were falling back to `?` 
- **Solution**: Integrated `github.com/mozillazg/go-unidecode` for comprehensive Unicode to ASCII conversion
- **Result**: Proper transliteration of all Unicode characters without `?` placeholders

### 2. Language/Script Detection ✅  
- **Issue**: Poor detection of source languages/scripts
- **Solution**: Enhanced detection algorithms with better Vietnamese, German, Chinese, and other script detection
- **Result**: More accurate language detection with confidence scores

### 3. Cultural Name Preservation ✅
- **Issue**: Vietnamese gender markers and cultural patterns not preserved
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced Vietnamese gender marker detection (Văn = male ~85%, Thị = female ~85%)
  - Added comprehensive Vietnamese diacritic mapping
  - Improved cultural name parsing for Vietnamese, Arabic, Indonesian, Chinese, etc.
- **Result**: Cultural markers properly preserved with gender inference

### 4. Frontend Improvements ✅
- **Issue**: Frontend had outdated examples and textarea
- **Solution**:
  - Changed to single input line with enter key submit
  - Added clickable example buttons with real test cases:
    - "Doctor Nguyễn Văn Minh" (Vietnamese with title and gender marker)  
    - "Prof. Jürgen Groß" (German with umlaut)
    - "李小龍" (Chinese characters)
    - "Tanaka-san Yoko" (Japanese - should not map -san to title)
    - "Maria del Carmen Núñez" (Spanish with particles)
- **Result**: Interactive examples that showcase the improved service

## Test Cases Validation ✅

All test cases from idea.md lines 733-737 are now working examples in the frontend:

1. ✅ "Doctor Nguyễn Văn Minh" → proper title extraction, family "NGUYEN", first "Minh", middle "Van", gender inference M (~0.85)
2. ✅ "Prof. Jürgen Groß" → title "Prof.", family "GROSS", first "Juergen" 
3. ✅ "李小龍" → family "LI", given name "Xiaolong" using enhanced Chinese mappings
4. ✅ "Tanaka-san Yoko" → correctly does NOT map "-san" to title, provides note
5. ✅ "Maria del Carmen Núñez" → family "NUNEZ", preserves "del Carmen" structure

## Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies Added:
- `github.com/mozillazg/go-unidecode` - For comprehensive Unicode transliteration
- Removed problematic `whatlanggo` dependency that was causing compilation issues

### Enhanced Modules:
- `internal/transliteration/` - Better Unicode handling, comprehensive diacritic mapping
- `internal/detection/` - Improved script and language detection  
- `internal/gender/` - Cultural gender inference with confidence scoring
- `frontend/` - Interactive UI with working examples and enter key submission

### Service Status: ✅ RUNNING
- API: https://staging-transliterate-5dsi.encr.app/transliterate
- Frontend: https://staging-transliterate-5dsi.encr.app/app
- All endpoints operational and responding correctly

## Key Improvements Made

1. **No more `?` characters** - All Unicode properly converted to meaningful ASCII
2. **Cultural awareness** - Vietnamese, German, Chinese, Arabic name patterns preserved  
3. **Gender inference** - Cultural markers detected with confidence scores
4. **Better UX** - Single input field, enter key submit, clickable examples
5. **Working test cases** - All 5 examples from the spec now working in production

The service now properly showcases transliteration capabilities and cultural name handling as requested.
