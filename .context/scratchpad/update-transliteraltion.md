the current output from the api does not match the intended contract, as detailed in the original idea @.context/idea.md and the test cases are not working as expected. See lines 733 to 737 of the file. create these 5 validation tests to run against the API. In each case there should be no ? characters in the output, and no Unicode/UTF-16 characters. Use whatever library necessary to map chinese to latin/ascii, japanese to latin/ascii, remove all decorators such as umlats, and transliterate things such as german "ÃŸ" to "ss". with the service running via 'encore run' continue to update the transliteration routine to correctly implement the intentions of the original idea and ensure these test cases are passing. ensure also that titles are not present in the name output as first or middle names. there are not that many titles so it should be simple to check for dr or mr or mrs etc. checkout a new feature branch to fix all these issues and dont stop until you have exhasted your capability or all tests pass.
