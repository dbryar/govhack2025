# Documentation Restructure Scratchpad

## Changes Made

### File Structure
- **Created**: `docs/overview.md` - Problem statement and navigation index
- **Renamed**: `docs/overview.md` → `docs/project.md` - Complete GovHack project details
- **Enhanced**: `docs/project.md` - Updated with real-world evidence from ABC article

### Key Insights from ABC Article

#### Real People, Real Problems
- **Trang Le (Vietnamese)**: Lê Thị Hiền Trang → incorrectly recorded as "Thị Lê"
  - Lost Pandemic Leave Disaster payment
  - Flight booking complications
  - Insurance application failures
  
#### Systematic Issues Identified
- **Vietnamese**: Gender markers (Thị/Văn) mistaken for first names
- **Indonesian/Myanmar**: Mononyms split incorrectly across first/last fields
- **Chinese**: Romanisation variants causing identity confusion, innocent arrests
- **Malaysian**: Patronymic structures (binti/bin) incompatible with Western assumptions

#### Evidence of Scale
- Westjustice "My Name" project: 450+ individuals assisted
- Multiple agencies affected: Services Australia, police, casinos, universities
- Criminal exploitation: Multiple identities through naming confusion

### Documentation Strategy Refinement

#### overview.md Purpose
- **Why the project exists** - emotional and human story
- **Navigation hub** - links to all technical documentation
- **Problem credibility** - real ABC article as source

#### project.md Focus
- **Competition deliverables** - GovHack specific requirements
- **Evidence-based claims** - citing real cases, not estimates
- **Technical solution** - how our API solves documented problems

### Key Messaging Updates

#### Before (Generic)
- "Foreign names create challenges"
- "Estimated impact"
- "Technical solution"

#### After (Evidence-Based)
- "Trang Le's specific story"
- "450+ documented cases from one legal centre"
- "Dr Price's 'multicultural name decoder' solution"

### Competition Advantages

1. **Real Problem**: ABC News article provides credible evidence
2. **Human Story**: Trang Le's personal impact resonates with judges
3. **Technical Precision**: We're building exactly what experts recommend
4. **Government Ready**: Addresses Services Australia's acknowledged issues

### Next Development Focus

Priority should be on **Vietnamese name handling** since:
- Most detailed in ABC article
- Clear technical requirements (Thị/Văn gender markers)
- High impact demonstration for judges
- Trang Le's story makes compelling video content

### Documentation Quality

- **Credibility**: Real ABC article source
- **Specificity**: Named individuals and organisations
- **Authority**: Expert quotes (Dr Price, Westjustice)
- **Impact**: Documented cases, not estimates
