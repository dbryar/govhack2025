# Frustrated with failing ID checks, migrants change their names to fit Australian databases

Trang Le almost gave up her given name to prevent confusion when proving her identity in Australia.

In Vietnam, Trang's full name is Lê Thị Hiền Trang.

But when Trang arrived in Australia, her first name was recorded as Thị because it immediately followed her family name, Lê.

At the advice of her friends, Trang was prepared to adopt Thị as her first name when she became an Australian citizen.

Under Vietnamese conventions, some traditional names begin with the family name followed by a name that indicates a person's gender and then a given name or names.

Văn is the gender-indicator for males, and Thị for females.

> "In the Vietnamese community we have a joke that every female Vietnamese Australian in Australia has the same name, Thị, because of how it's messed up," she said.

> "I know a Vietnamese couple who after taking Australian citizenship are now called Thị and Văn as their first names," she said.

For Trang, this discrepancy between her Vietnamese passport and her Australian identity documents meant she missed out on her Pandemic Leave Disaster payment and required extra police checks for different versions of her name.

She also had trouble registering for insurance via an online application form because her last name, Le, did not meet the minimum three letters required.

But the largest barrier she has faced was satisfying immigration authorities when travelling between Vietnam and Australia.

The first time she booked a flight back to Vietnam, she booked her ticket under her given name, Trang, which caused her to be questioned at the check-in counter.

She explained that she had also dropped the first part of her given name, "Hiền", for simplicity.

> "Next time I booked my flight I made sure to identify my name as Thị so I wouldn't be stopped at the Australian airport," she told the ABC.

> "But that created an issue when I boarded the flight from my home country because the officials [in Vietnam] understood my name as Trang, so they would question me as to why I put my name as Thị.

> "I feel frustrated, sometimes stressed.

> "It created additional labour for me — the actual labour of having to accumulate a large amount of identity documents and the emotional labour of constantly worrying."

In the lead-up to her citizenship ceremony, the official completing her paperwork supported her to use Trang as her given name, which was heartening.

She hoped being granted citizenship with her preferred name order would streamline future travel and administrative paperwork.

## Trouble with mononyms

In some Asian countries, like Indonesia, India, and Myanmar, having a single name, or mononym, is common.

For members of the Karen, Kareni, and Chin ethnic groups who have fled Myanmar, this makes getting concessions, filling prescriptions, banking and even registering marriages difficult.

Joseph Nunweek, the legal director at Westjustice community legal centre, said Australian services and databases would register their single names in different ways — as a first name, last name, or split across both categories.

He said this created inconsistencies, for example, when drivers licenses did not match concession cards.

> "Anywhere where identity is tested or called into question can create these administrative barriers, but the concessions are particularly frustrating given the financial impost," he said.

Heather Neilson, from Westjustice's Burmese financial counselling clinic, said the problem could be addressed with changing the information on government concession cards.

She said the cards did not indicate if the single name was a family name, a first name, or a single-name family name, and could be different to how individuals understood their name to be.

> "A lot of people are missing out on concessions, not to mention feeling quite concerned about how their naming conventions are received in Australia," she said.
> Ms Neilson said as a client's "last port of call", she needed to be "belligerent" in escalating issues and advocating on their behalf, which was frustrating, time-consuming and costly.

Westjustice used to run a project called My Name that assisted about 80 families and 450 individuals to rectify incorrectly recorded names.

The centre has also helped those who wanted a shared family name, or one that reflected their cultural or religious identity.

But Mr Nunweek stressed it was important that clients avoided changing their name to circumvent repeated friction and fatigue with administrative systems because of the inflexibility of recording names.

For those clients who were proud of their name and had strong attachments to it, Mr Nunweek and Ms Neilson believed it was the systems that needed changing.

> "We need to change. We don't need to impose a naming convention on people who already have got one," Ms Neilson said.

## Names being exploited by criminals

Fiona Swee-Lin Price, from Globalise Consulting, has worked with universities, libraries, police, defence, and casinos to improve understanding of non-Anglo-Saxon naming pronunciations and structures.

As a cross-cultural trainer, Dr Price has helped universities with graduation ceremonies and taught administrative staff how to interpret overseas transcripts to correctly input student data into their databases.

> "Most databases that are designed for an English-speaking country don't have the boxes that are needed for names that come from a lot of non-Anglo cultures," she said.

> "It assumed people understood the differences between first, given, middle, family, last, and surname labels and how to record their names in the appropriate boxes," she said.

A Malaysian name like Sharifah binti Faisal has no family name because in Malay culture children are named to reflect paternal lineage.

> "You don't have a box that's labelled 'father's name' but you get a lot of Muslim cultures where your second name is actually your father's name," she said.

Dr Price said the lack of understanding of multicultural naming structures in Australia was also being exploited by criminals.

She delivered a workshop to a large casino to help them understand how Chinese names could be used to created multiple identities.

The same Chinese characters can be spelt differently in English depending on whether the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation is used.

She said tonal information used to distinguish between individuals was also lost when anglicising Chinese names, leading to innocent people being arrested because their name was spelt the same as wanted suspects.

Dr Price said the best way to prevent confusion was to avoid "corralling names" into fields that were suited for a monocultural society.

She suggested using a "multicultural name decoder" to help people familiar with Anglo-Saxon name structures interpret names from different cultures consistently and convert them for an Australian context.

The team from Westjustice said there needed to be political will to reform client management databases nationwide, and it would need buy-in from software companies.

> "Utility companies and government departments of this world look to who is setting up this system in terms of doing the right thing, so I think it needs to involve those people understanding it as well," said Mr Nunweek.

> Meanwhile, Ms Neilson said: "It's a systemic issue rather than a deliberate ploy to disadvantage people but it's one of those issues that requires a lot of back-end work and a fair bit of money as well."

Services Australia general manager Hank Jongen said the agency had implemented naming guides for staff that explained different conventions, and how to properly record names.

He said customers should contact them if their name was recorded incorrectly and could access free interpretation and translation services for more than 200 languages.

The ABC understands concession cards have character limits because of their size, and when a name exceeded the limit, it was shortened to the maximum character length in accordance with its rules.

The cards also need to include partner and dependent children's names, which creates additional sizing constraints.
