## Community AI Agents: Bridging Service Access Gaps

**Jurisdiction:** Australia
#Empower #Connect #Include

> How can we design Agentic AI solutions that autonomously assist residents in discovering, accessing, and engaging with local government and community services?

As communities grow more diverse, the complexity of accessing government and social services increases. Many residents lack the time, knowledge, or digital skills to navigate these systems. The advent of AI agents, which are 'virtual coworkers' that can act autonomously to execute tasks, interact with both humans and systems, and adapt in real time offers a tremendous opportunity to support the community such as in accessing government services. For example, imagine an AI agent that not only tells you where the nearest food bank is but also books a slot, sends reminders, and connects you with volunteers that can answer your questions on the food bank service.

This challenge invites participants to build Agentic AI agents that act as personal community assistants for identifying needs, finding solutions, and executing tasks. The solution should demonstrate autonomy, adaptability, and inclusivity, ensuring it works for digitally excluded populations.

Guiding questions include:

- How can Agentic AI agents proactively identify community needs and connect residents to relevant government or local services without requiring complex user input?
- What strategies can ensure these AI agents are inclusive and accessible for people with low digital literacy, language barriers, or disabilities?
- How can the AI agent autonomously perform multi-step tasks (e.g., booking appointments, filling forms, sending reminders) while maintaining user trust, security, and data privacy?
- What mechanisms can be implemented for the AI agent to continuously learn and adapt to changing community needs and service availability?
- How can the solution foster social cohesion beyond just providing information—by encouraging engagement, collaboration, and mutual support within the community?

You are expected to deliver:

- A specific proposal that addresses how AI can make government and community services more accessible
- A detailed model or plan that integrates AI to improve services. Ensure the plan addresses ethical, privacy, and trust concerns while being practical and caters for digitally excluded groups (e.g., elderly, migrants, low-income households)
- Specific examples or simulations to illustrate the effectiveness and potential impact of your proposed solutions. Demonstrate how your solution can be scaled or adapted to different public sector contexts
- A presentation summarising your solution

## Connecting New Citizens to Australian Democracy

**Jurisdiction:** Australia
#Democracy-in-practice

> How might we design new ways to strengthen sense of belonging, civic knowledge and community connection for people engaging with democratic systems and services for the first time?

Becoming an Australian citizen is a significant milestone, but the journey of belonging, connection and participation continues well beyond the ceremony. In the years after citizenship, new Australians often face challenges in fully engaging and integrating in their communities, building social connections and navigating democratic systems and the practices of civic life.
Recent research from the Resilient Democracy Research and Data Network (https://australiandemocraticresilience.substack.com/p/introducing-the-australian-resilient) shows declining rates of civic participation and volunteering in Australia over the past three decades. Both experiential and classroom-based civic education are crucial, yet most programs don’t continue beyond the schooling years, leaving new Australians with limited opportunities to gain practical civic knowledge beyond the citizenship test.

This challenge is your chance to identify the gaps that exist in the current offering and design innovative, practical solutions that empower new Australians to:

- Experience hands-on civic education and learn how Australian democracy works in real life
- Navigate and access public services with confidence, including through engagement with their elected representatives
- Get involved in local events and discover opportunities to engage with community including through volunteering
- Grow their understanding of civic rights and responsibilities and how to leverage these to benefit their community
- Connect with others and participate in community decision-making, both online and in person
  Bring your creativity and passion to our challenge and help shape a future where every person feels valued and empowered to contribute. Let’s build a more resilient, vibrant Australia—starting now!

This GovHack challenge is seeking to identify practical, innovative and scalable solutions that help new Australians:

- Build a deeper sense of belonging and connection to Australian society and its diverse communities
- Strengthen civic knowledge and confidence in understanding rights, responsibilities and democratic processes
- Enhance opportunities for active participation, volunteering and contributions to communities, and
- Improve satisfaction and trust in Australian democracy and democratic institutions
  We welcome creative ideas that could take the form of digital tools, social innovations, community-driven approaches or cross-sector partnerships, incorporating government data. The best solutions will be those that, are inclusive, practical to implement and capable of making a real-world difference at scale.
